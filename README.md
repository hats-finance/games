# Hats Challenge #1

## Task: obtain the flag

`Game.sol` encodes a fighting game where you can pitch decks of Mons against the deck of the flagholder, in order to obtain the flag:

- anyone can join the game calling `game.join()`
- on joining, a player receives a deck of 3 pseudo-random Mons
- each Mon is an NFT, and each Mon has powers: FIRE; WATER; AIR and SPEED, each with a value in a range from [0,9]
- users can try to improve their deck by swapping their Mons with other users, or by exchanging a Mon for a randomly generated new one
- for a swap to succeed, another player must put of one of their Mons for sale

- at each moment, one player holds the flag
- other players can try to capture the flag by fighting the flag holder
- Fight between single Mons: can fight in one of the 3 elements (FIRE, WATER or AIR). The Mon with the highest value in that element wins. If the score is the equal, the fastest monster wins.
- A fight between two decks consists of pairing the three Mons of the challenger with the 3 Mons of the flag holder, pseudo-randomly choosing 3 elements, and then having the 3 pairs fight in each of these elements

##Â THE HATS CHALLENGE:

- Obtain the flag: i.e. `game.flag()` should return an address that you control
